Goal
For this project we would like you to refactor the code in "someMethod()" to be more readable and less mistake prone.

Description
The method "someMethod()" has some issues despite being short.  It is difficult to understand and will be very error prone when it must be maintained.  Use good techniques for working with legacy code to characterize and then refactor the hazardous method.
