code-katas
=========

A place for me to store various implementations of code katas I've done, mostly for me to look at later.

You'll find:

<dl>
<dt>Bowling Game
<dd>The classic kata from Uncle Bob Martin
<dt>Decorator Dojo
<dd>A coding exercise I've used to teach the Decorator pattern
<dt>Prime Factors
<dd>A kata about finding the prime factors of a number
<dt>Secret Santa
<dd>Take an input file of names and pair people.
<dt>Robocode
<dd>An implementation of a Robocode robot in F#. It's terrible, but it was a learning experience for me.

Each folder has implementations in a variety of languages. The Bowling Game kata is the most varied.
